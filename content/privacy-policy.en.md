## 2. Types of Data Processed and Purposes

This web application serves the sole purpose of displaying the **digital menu** of the restaurant. No user registration is required and no direct personal data (such as name, surname or email) is collected through the site.

However, for the technical functioning of the service, the following data is processed:

### A. Navigation Data and System Logs

The computer systems responsible for the operation of this site acquire, during their normal operation, some personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols (e.g. IP addresses, request times).

This data is used by hosting providers (see "Third Party Services" section) exclusively for security and diagnostic purposes.

### B. Preferences saved on device (Local Storage)

To improve the user experience, this site uses a technology called **"Local Storage"** (Browser Local Storage). We use this technical memory to temporarily save on your device:

- **Preferred language** (Italian/English)
- **Dietary preferences** (vegetarian, vegan)
- **Allergens to exclude**
- **Interface state** (open or closed menu sections)

**Purpose**: This allows the site to remember your choices if you reload the page or return to the menu after a short time, avoiding having to re-select everything from scratch.

> **Important note**: This data remains exclusively on your device, it is never transmitted to our servers nor used for advertising profiling or tracking.

## 3. Cookies and Local Storage

This site **does NOT use profiling or marketing cookies** (own or third-party) that require prior user consent.

The technology used (Local Storage) is classified as **technical**. According to current regulations (ePrivacy Directive and GDPR), the installation of such technical tools strictly necessary for the functioning of the service or for saving user preferences does not require consent via banner.

The user can delete this data at any time by clearing their browser cache.

---

## 4. Third Party Services

To provide the service, we rely on trusted external suppliers. The use of these services involves a technical transmission of the user's IP address necessary for the connection.

### GitHub Pages (Hosting)

The site is hosted on GitHub, Inc. servers. GitHub may collect access logs (including IP addresses) for security purposes (attack prevention, abuse).

[GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

### Google Sheets (Database)

Menu data (dishes, prices, allergens) is dynamically loaded from a file hosted on Google Sheets (Google Ireland Ltd / Google LLC). When the browser downloads the menu, it makes a direct connection to Google servers. Google processes the user's IP address to transmit the requested data.

## 5. User Rights

In accordance with GDPR (Articles 15-22), users have the right to request from the Data Controller:

- Access to their data
- Rectification of inaccurate data
- Deletion of data (where applicable)
- Opposition to processing for legitimate reasons
- Data portability

Since this site does not save personally identifiable data (names, emails) on its servers, the exercise of some rights may be limited to the deletion of local data (browser cache) which can be done independently by the user.

For any information or request, you can contact the Data Controller at the email address indicated above.
